# Vacuum Cleaner Simulation

## Description
This is a simple Java simulation where you control a vacuum cleaner represented by a triangle. You can place black dots anywhere on the field by clicking the mouse. The vacuum cleaner automatically moves toward and collects all the dots on the field as quickly as possible.

## How It Works
- The vacuum cleaner (triangle) moves on its own.
- Each mouse click adds a new black dot (dirt) at the clicked location.
- The vacuum cleaner continuously navigates to the nearest dot and "cleans" it by reaching its position.
- The goal is to clear all dots from the field.

## Controls
- **Mouse Click**: Place a black dot (dirt) on the field.

## Features
- Autonomous vacuum cleaner movement.
- Simple point placement and navigation.
- Visual representation with a triangle vacuum and black dots.
